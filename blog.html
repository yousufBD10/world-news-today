              <p class="text-bold text-lg">A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a variable exists and what value it should start with. Similar to other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the declaration of variables.
                <br>
                There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const. Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create can be used.
                <br>
                <span class="text-xl">let</span>: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.
                <br>
                <span class="text-xl">var</span>: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.

                <br>
                <span class="text-xl">const</span>: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
                Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>

              <small>Date : 3 Semtember 2022</small>
              <p class="text-bold text-lg">The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this) is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow function's this being resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in which the arrow function was defined).Function.prototype.call(), Function.prototype.bind() and Function.prototype.apply() do not work correctly with arrow functions either. Their purpose is to allow methods to execute within different scopes, but the this value of an arrow function cannot be changed, as it's resolved lexically.</p>

              <small>Date : 3 Semtember 2022</small>
              <p class="text-bold text-lg">The main difference between this two methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one.When we work with an array, it is an essential step to iterate on the array to access elements and performing some kind of functionality on those elements to accomplish any task.
                For example, If you have an array of marks obtained by 20 students and you want to calculate their GPA, if you have an array of images and you want to render it on the frontend, etc. To manage such cases, you must have proper knowledge of how to access the element of the array and how to operate on them. 
                <br>
                Other than the basic language constructs i.e. for loop, while loop, and do-while loop, there are two widely used methods for iteration.
                <br>
                .forEach() and .map(): These are the methods that are used to iterate on an array, more technically they invoke the provided callback function for every element of an array.

                <span class="text-xl">Syntax</span>:Parameters:
                <br>

                <span class="text-xl">  currentElement:</span> This is the current element that is being processed in the <br>
                indexOfElement: The index of that current element inside the array.<br>
                <span class="text-xl">  array:</span> : The array on which the whole operation is being performed.<br>
                <span class="text-xl">    Example 1:</span>    : Our objective is to create such a type of functionality that can give square values of the elements of a given array. We have created two arrays, one is working with the forEach() and the other with the map(), and both producing the same result. The element and index are being accessed inside the callback function and we are assigning the square of each element at that index.</p>
